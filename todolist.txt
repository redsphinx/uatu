. finish the lstm part of the convolutional RNN

notes:
.tf.nn.rnn creates an unrolled graph for a fixed RNN length. That means, if you call tf.nn.rnn with inputs having 200 time steps you are creating a static graph with 200 RNN steps. First, graph creation is slow. Second, you’re unable to pass in longer sequences (> 200) than you’ve originally specified. tf.nn.dynamic_rnn solves this. It uses a tf.While loop to dynamically construct the graph when it is executed. That means graph creation is faster and you can feed batches of variable size.

. started with lstm part of the convolutional RNN
. downloaded parts of CASIA

notes:
. 3D convolutions are computationally expensive but they are able to handle sequence of images

DONE . research gpu

DONE . figure out why loss becomes NaN DONE
-probably overfitting
-hidden layers can make gradients unstable. use Xavier initialization to fix.
-the variance of the initial values will tend to be too high, causing instability. Also, decreasing the learning rate may help
--Decreasing the learning rate solved the issue
--Xavier initialized: errors go to zero but only if I initialize the conv weights to xavier. initializing the conv biases to xavier leads to more normal errors. not true, the zero thing only happened once apparently...weird. Overall initialization with Xavier leads to lower minibatch loss at the start

DONE . monitoring with tensorboard DONE

DONE . update data latex with info about HDA and hard negative mining
